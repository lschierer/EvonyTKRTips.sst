Most sites offering ratings of generals have flaws. While I personally have really appreciated the work done
on [EvonyAnswers], I find that even it falls down when I do not want, or cannot afford, to split my
attention between separate generals for attack and re-enforcement, or want to know what is the best pair for a
secondary use case that will receive less attention.

This hopes to help partially close that gap. Unlike most sites, I am
evaluating pairs, not individual generals. I am making some judgements on
buffs you might need, but far fewer than [EvonyAnswers] does.  Where
[EvonyAnswers] provides just a few numbers per pair, one each at fully ascended
and at four yellow specialities but no ascending for each of the two
primary use cases (Attacking and Reinforcing), I am allowing for effectively
infinitely variable levels of investment.  I have used [EvonyAnswers] Attribute
Ranking System to help simplify the display, reducing several different
buffs into just a small handful of numbers for easier analysis. However, by
breaking the single [EvonyAnswers] Attribute Ranking Score into several scores,
I hope to offer greater insight into *why* the general is ranked that way, and
also allow the user to focus in on particular aspects of strength that matter
most to that user.

The EvAns Estimate columns, where available, represent my best effort at reproducing
the Attribute Ranking Scores from [EvonyAnswers] as [documented here].  I have not
succeeded in accurately doing so, hence they are labeled "estimates."  Despite many
hours of trying to find any flaws in my algorithm, I am variable amounts off, with each
general off a unique amount.

**_Since All columns use the same algorithm, albeit in slightly different ways, please use
these tables at your own risk, and consider this a work in progress._**

The 4 main troop types, Archers, Cavalry, Ground, and Siege, each have two additional columns
specific to me: an "Adjusted Attack Score" and an "Adjusted Toughness Score."  The Adjusted Attack
is comprised of your general's march capacity buffs, attack buffs, HP *de*buffs, and defense *de*buffs.
The Adjusted Toughness Score is comprised of your general's HP buffs, defense buffs, and attack *de*buffs.
Buffs that [EvonyAnswers] lists as "Preservation," and "Debilitation" are currently entirely ignored.
Range increase buffs are used towards the Adjusted Attack for Archers and Siege types, however, In-Battle
speed buffs are currently ignored for Ground and Cavalry types.   Additionally, the Rally capacity is
counted towards Attack only for the Attack case, not for the Reinforcing case.  Lastly, Buffs and Debuffs are
adjusted in all cases to account for conditions where they do and do not take effect (I actually think this might
be where I and [EvonyAnswers] might be drawing different conclusions, and thus different scores).

For anyone trying to reproduce *my* numbers, I have used the multipliers listed at [EvonyAnswers] as of the "4.2.0"
version.  I'm strongly considering customizing them, and if so, will post the ones I use on a page similar to what
was done there.

Wall Generals are evaluated very similar to the way a Reinforcing use case general is evaluated, with the exception
that all troop types are used, and march size is irrelevant.  Mayors for Sub Cities however, really only need to be
evaluated for their various debuffs.  These need to be evaluated with much more granularity, with Anti-Attack and
Anti-Toughness debuffs shown for any given investment level for each potential Mayor.  I may include a Toughness
column in the sense that will help yur Mayor *have troops* and thus *get used* but a Mayor's contribution to your
attack is going to be, as has been discussed elsewhere, massively limited by the anemic troops and miniscule troop
counts available to that Mayor.  Thus I will be entirely discounting a Mayor's attack buffs.

Eventually I would like to allow for Officer comparison, but that's really only useful if I can figure out
how to do side-by-side comparison of generals *at different investment* levels.  Otherwise the analysis is
trivial. Currently I can only do one investment level per table, and until that limitation is solved, putting
officers into a table is pointless.

Like all my pages, this is a work in progress. I hope to do more with it
over time. Right now the lists of generals are based on static assessment of
which generals do and do not conflict, thus it is possible that there are
both false positives and false negatives. It also currently has a medium
set of generals. I hope to continue to expand that over time.

Don't see the general you want to compare? Go to the [General Yaml Creator]
and fill in the values. You can submit it to me any time the box on the
right is green, but the more information you provide, the less I have to
find before I can post it.

## Usage Key
  * Standard skill books
    * If a general conflicts no matter where in the pair
      this book is used, you will see an orange dot next to the general's name.
    * If the general conflicts only if he or she does not personally have that skill
      book, you will see a blue dot next to his or her name.
    * In either case, any skill book(s) you yourself add are not counted towards buffs at this time.
  * General Covenants are not counted towards buffs at this time.
  * General Soul Binding is not counted towards buffs at this time.
  * Buffs that require a Spiritual Beast or Dragon to activate are indicated by a magenta (pink) dot
    next to the general's name. This will override a blue dot, but not an orange dot.
  * Gray dots means there are no special considerations.
