There are lots of sites out there with tips on playing Evony.  Why am I
creating yet another?  I find that the advice I am giving younger and/or less
knowledgable players differs from what I find on any single site out there.
This is largely because so many of the sites are targeted on people who spend
far more on the game than I do.  While they have tons of very valuable info,
figuring out the right course for the player with a smaller budget can be a
real challenge.  This site is based on my experiences playing on a more limited
budget.

Much of the information here comes from other authors' work on other sites.  In particular, I am heavily relying on the work of 
* [Evony Answers](https://www.evonyanswers.com/)
* [Evony: The King's Return GUIDE WIKI](https://evonyguidewiki.com/)
* [One Chilled Gamer](https://onechilledgamer.com/)
* [Evony The King's Return Guides](https://www.evonytkrguide.com/)

Many thanks to the incredible work put forth by those who have come before me on these sites in documenting Evony TKR.
