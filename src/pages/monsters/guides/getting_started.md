### Get a General

So you want to kill monsters.  First, you need at least one general, preferably
a pair of them.  I have [a guide dedicated to this][mg].  Your pair of generals
do not need to be fully developed to start your monster hunting journey.  You
can start as soon as you get that first good mounted general.  However, as you
develop your pair of generals, you will find that you can do **_much_** more
with the same troops.  You will have to somewhat feel your way out and figure
out what is and is not within your reach based on the generals you have.

### Picking Troops 

As you can guess from the fact that is the mounted general guide, you will be
using mounted troops.  Some tips here.

1. Use _**ONLY**_ mounted troops.  
   * Mixing troop types will almost always result in more wounded.
   * The only exception to this is that _very occasionally_ when you add a few
	 ranged to an otherwise mounted march, you can bump yourself over the edge
	 and kill something that is otherwise outside of your reach.  Doing it this
	 way *will involve getting wounded.*
   * the Pans event will suggest using other troop types.  Following its
     recommendation will allow you to kill bigger Pans sooner, but with enough
     mounted you can do the same thing.
1. Use _**ONLY**_ one tier of troops.  Depending on your culture, the names for
   each troop type and troop tier within each type change.  The [roman numerals][]
   for them do not.  Thus we typically ignore the names and prefix these roman
   numerals with a 't' for "tier", using that in place of the name. 
1. When joining a rally someone else started, send *just one* troop, and your general.
   * You will get the same rewards no matter how much or how little you contribute to the rally.
   * Due to the way rallies against monsters function, anything you send will
	 operate semi-independently from the main force sent by the person who
	 started the rally.  You cannot actually help them unless they are close to
	 losing entirely. 
   * Thus sending more than one is simply asking for bigger numbers of troops
     to heal, without gain.
	
### Equipment

1. You should be using mounted monarch gear.  This matters a great deal. 
1. You should be using the soul set of blazons for mounted. 
1. Do not craft armor or weapons until you can craft a King's set. Even then
   consider waiting until you can craft a Dragon Set. 
   * You may want hang on to some of the armor that you win for free.  This can be used as something to cheaply refine during events.
   * If you have free armor, go ahead and use it while waiting for the armor
     you want. Just do not invest any significant amount of gems or gold into
     it.
   * Set bonuses for multiple pieces of armor/weapons from the same set can
     matter a _**great**_ deal.  Pay attention.
   * Do NOT bother refining King's gear.  
   * It CAN be worth refining Dragon's gear, even though it takes a ton of
     gems, and even though much of it will be either upgraded into Ares gear or
     replaced by Achaemenidae gear. 
   * Most players who avoid spending a _**great deal**_ will have trouble
     crafting meaningful amounts of civilization gear.  Watch out for the
     impact of losing those set bonuses. 
1. Use the Bird of Hurricane until you have a fafnir (purple) dragon.  Then switch to that. 
   * Go ahead and level the spiritual beast up.  Yes, it requires gems, gold,
     and medals.  Everything in the game takes something that you wish you had
     more of.
   * Some players prefer the Pegasus over the Bird of Hurricane.  The Pegasus
     is really a PvP beast, but will work for monster hunting also.
1. When you get the fafnir (purple) dragon 
   * you need to feed it to make it be worthwhile. 
   * refines on your dragon also matter
   * activate the talents on the dragon.  These can be leveled up as well.  The
     siege talent on this dragon doesn't help you.
1. Switching your beast or dragon requires a one hour cool down period.  This
   means you have to plan well in advance of when you need that switch.
