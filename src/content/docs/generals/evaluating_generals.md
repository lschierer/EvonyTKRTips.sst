title: Evaluating Generals

I've been watching John Wick's videos and while a general with a specialized buff will theoretically be stronger, they
are *more specialized* and will be weaker for corresponding use cases. I'm thus *penalizing* a general for having an
adverb on his/her buff unless being evaluated for a specialty role.

I am unsure how much to count death into wounded. It definitely helps your survivability, but both in battlefield and
SvS "death" is modified drastically anyway. If you are on a BoB server where actual troop death is a serious concern,
then you probably ought to just bubble up and not worry about your generals anyway, or cut your losses and find a new
server.

* Assume a Marching or Attacking buff has a 50% debuff 
  applied
* Assume "When Rallying" gets a 50% debuff - see attacking
* Assume a reinforcing buff is useful only to big players 
  and discount it unless evaluating for that.
* Count 25% of reinforcing and "when defending" for 
  siege generals because you will probably actually do 
  that.
* conversely, for siege generals, I am going to debuf
  marching/attacking by 75% simply because it makes
  them less useful.
* In City means Wall General only (since we discount 
  reinforcing).
* Discount officer buffs unless looking for an officer.
* Discount against monster buffs unless looking for a 
  PvM general.
* Discount a "when defending" buff unless looking for a 
  Wall General - see reinforcing.
* Look at both "when defending" and "when main defense 
  general" buffs for wall generals.
* Debuffs are important.
* Rally Capacity and March size are worth considering, 
  but are NOT the same. March size is MUCH more valuable.
* There is at least one general with a "during Svs" buff. I am inclined to discount this as well. This site is targeted
  at people who need to be able to use their generals 
  in all PvP use cases. Having separate PvP and PvM 
  generals will be difficult enough.

This list of criteria goes against the grain, and even where my source sites attempt to help those who are not heavy
spenders, they do not go as far as this. If you disagree, well, there are other lists and other sites out there.
