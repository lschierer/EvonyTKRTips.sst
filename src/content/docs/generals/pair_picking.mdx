        As I have said, most sites offering ratings of generals have flaws.
        While I personally have really appreciated the work done on [EvonyAnswers],
        I find that even it falls down when I do not want, or cannot afford, to
        split my attention between separate generals for attack and
        re-enforcement, or want to know what is the best pair for a secondary
        use case that will receive less attention.

        This hopes to help partially close that gap.  Unlike most sites, I am
        evaluating pairs, not  individual generals.  Unlike even [EvonyAnswers],
        which *does* evaluate  pairs, I am not making judgements about which
        attributes you might need. I simply provide filtering so that only buffs
        that apply to the use case you select get used when computing how much
        of each kind of buff that pair will bring to the table.

        Like all my pages, this is a work in progress.  I hope to do more with
        it over time.   Right now the lists of generals are based on static
        assessment of which generals do and do not conflict, thus it is possible
        that there are both false positives and false negatives.  It also
        currently has a very small set of generals.   I hope to expand that
        over time.
