In the [Overview][], I explain my thinking.  This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how I
arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you can
skip it and dive right in here. 

[Overview]: <../overview/>
:::
Your Siege generals will be the *last* PvP generals you invest [rune stones][]
and [BoA][] on.  This is because siege troops require gems to heal.

### For Free to Play Players:

There are only two traditionally recommended generals that are also easily 
[ascended][] by a F2P player for siege troops:
* Matthias I (604)
* Ulysses S. Grant [D] (602)

That 'D' signifies that Grant requires a dragon to be of any use, and neither
of these are great options to begin with.  That being said, Napoleon is fairly
easy to win, so even a free player might get enough copies of him to give him
at least one or two red stars.  I am unsure how a Napoleon with one red star
compares to a Matthias with three or more red stars.

However, my analysis indicates that **Suleiman the Magnificent** is consistently 
undervalued and underrated.  Ascended to three red stars, pairs with him as lead
have similar attack buffs as the current leading premium generals once you realize
that his [debuffs] will make the attack he does have more effective.  

He is thus my recommendation.  You should then pick one of the many premium generals
that Suleiman pairs with as your assistant.

### For Light Spenders

For light spenders, it is increasingly the case that the best choices for
primary generals are premium generals.  Additionally, because the siege general
*is* the last general you should be working on anyway, you have more time to
slowly, over the course of (literally) years, assemble the fragments you
need to [ascend][] this general.  My advice is to hang onto every copy of all
of the following generals that you come across:

* Pallas
* Raimondo
* Kleos
* Zucca 
* John Churchill 
* Edward Teach [D S] 
* Petronas 

However, only actually add skill books to whichever one you happen to get
first, and only ever use this general in [BoC][] or [BoG][].  

You have lots of options for pairings depending on which general ends up being
your main general. This is because for Edward Teach and Suleiman dominate the
assistant general space. Edward Teach is noticeably better, especially if you
have enough dragons and spiritual beasts to give both your primary and
assistant generals a beast, but even without that, he is still the superior
choice.  That being said, Suleiman still scores A to A+ depending on who is is
assistant for and remains a respectable choice.  

Do note that Edward Teach is also listed as a possible primary general.
Obviously he cannot be both primary and assistant, and he is one of the rare
generals who conflicts with Suleiman.  Simply use any of the other three
suggested primary generals as your assistant, with the preference being Zucca,
Petronas, John Churchill (because of the way assistants work, Petronas brings
more to the table than Churchill). 

Eventually you will have your [ranged][], [ground][], [wall][], and not just
one [mounted][] but both a PvP and Monster pair in this type all maxed out on
[rune stones][], and all either [ascended][] or waiting on more fragments to
finish ascending.  *Then and only then* will you evaluate which of the four
above generals you have the most fragments of and from that which one to start
developing.  In fact, you might even wait until you have *Suleiman's* (or
Teach's) specialties maxed out to four gold as well before deciding (although
remember not to ascend your assistant).

Lastly, keep in mind that siege is often the best troop class to use for 
reinforcing someone's keep.  However, due to the way that [buff] activation
conditions work, many of these premium generals face significant disadvantages
when used this way.  Raimondo, Teach, and Suleiman will retain their value, and 
Septimius Severus, who when evaluated as an attack general falls just below top 
tier, starts to look much more attractive.
