In the [Overview][], I explain my thinking.  This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how I
arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you can
skip it and dive right in here. 

[Overview]: <overview>

### For Free to Play Players:

You will be using ranged as your main PVP force.

Elektra will be your main general.  While there are much better options,
you will have trouble fully ascending any of them because 
* they are all premium generals 
* not only are they premium generals, but some are most event generals

Give her the following skill books:
* Ranged Attack Increase
* Ranged Troop Range Increase
* Ranged Troop HP *OR* Ranged Troop Defense

Your assistant general will initially be Gwanggaeto the Great.  You can find
him in the Tavern.  However, eventually you will win Mehmed II from King's
Path.  Switch to him when you can, *unless* you have already used rune stones
on Gwanggaeto by that point (the difference is noticeable, but not huge).

Give your assistant the following skill books:
* March Size Increase
* March Speed Increase
* Whichever of Ranged Troop HP *OR* Ranged Troop Defense is NOT on Elektra

### Light Spenders:

You will also use Elektra as your main ranged General, and this pair will be
your main PVP march.

Keep your eye out for any of the following (this is a ordered list)

* Charles XII Eleanor (254)
* Douglas [D S] (253)
* Charles XII (250)
* James Conrad (247)
* Princess Kaguya (228)
* Mason Weaver [D S] (216)
* Douglas [ND S] (208)
* Alfred the Great (198)

These are all available for paying players. Particularly, Alfred is available
in the Alliance Shop if you buy the Alliance Shop card.  Once you have invested
rune stones in any of these, *stick with that one*.  Note, these will be your
*assistant generals* because getting fragments for any of them (except possibly
Alfred if you spend to get the Alliance Shop card consistently) will
potentially be very expensive.

IF you pick Princess Kaguya, you *may* want to change the skill books on her:
* Siege Machine Attack
* Siege Machine Range Bonus
* March Size Increase

This build sacrifices speed and some durability in favor of mixing ranged and
siege into a single attack march.  This should be carefully considered as it
can cost many more gems for healing.

### Medium Spenders:

Evony is pushing hard to make us all pay for our generals.  Elektra's best pair 
is currently ranked 56 and scores a B+.  That is honestly not *really* worth 
investing in at all.  I am only recommending her for the light spenders because
I am already telling the that they have to spend for their primary ground and 
siege generals, and their wall assistant.  Having to spend to ascend a ranged
general to start having a strong PvP march is not acceptable. 

So for a medium spender, go ahead and start to ascend Elektra, but watch for
fragments from the following generals.  It is not clear to me how frequently they
be available and thus which you are best to go all out for.

* Douglas [D S] (777)
* Charles XII (736)
* James Conrad (724)

Note the difference in their scores here from their scores as assistants.  That 
is because here they are being scored with having been fully ascended, and when
taking into account their personal attributes and not just their skills and
specialities.  

All of them accept the same assistants:
* Eleanor (254)
* Mason Weaver [D S] (216)
* Vladimir the Great (200)
* Edward III (191)
* Winfield Scott (182)
* Toyotomi Hideyori (172)
* Mason Weaver [ND S] (168)
* Gwanggaeto the Great (163)

You really, however, want to pick one of the top four, and even then you might
that choice temporary because Eleanor is simply that strong, and you might well
want to hold out for her.  Do keep in mind that [D S] notation on Mason Weaver.
It means that even as an assistant, and despite the fact that you will not get 
the full benefit from it, you must assign either a dragon or a spiritual beast
to her. Interestingly, even without that, she still makes the top ten assistants 
list.

If you do pick Eleanor, she *must* have the march size skill book for full
effectiveness. 

To achieve full effectiveness, Elektra, Winfield Scott, and Vladimir the Great 
should be using the Ranged Attack Increase Skill Book.  For combinations with 
two (2) of them, to achieve maximum effectiveness, the *lead general* should 
be using the Ranged Attack Increase Skill Book.

To achieve full effectiveness, Edward III should be using the Ranged Defense 
Increase Skill Book.

Because of these considerations, you may need to adjust your skill books from 
the recommendations given above. 

I do not consider the investment in Elektra and whomever you pick as her partner
to be wasted resources.  Firstly, an Elektra with three or four stars might well 
be stronger than Douglas with only one.  Secondly because when you do eventually 
reach keep 35 or 36 and stop ghosting, you are quite likely to like having two 
strong marches for battlefield.   Third, building off of point number one, 
despite the fact that all but one of these generals has been out for some months,
Douglas, the newest of them, is the *only* one that I have a copy of, and *no* 
fragments of.  You will need a strong general in the mean time.
