In the [Overview][], I explain my thinking.  This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how I
arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you can
skip it and dive right in here. 

[Overview]: <{{< relref "overview.md" >}}>

### For Free to Play Players:

You will be using ranged as your main PVP force.

Elektra will be your main general.  While there are technically better options,
you will have trouble fully ascending any of those theoretically better
options.

Give her the following skill books:
* Ranged Attack Increase
* Ranged Troop Range Increase
* Ranged Troop HP *OR* Ranged Troop Defense

Your assistant general will initially be Gwanggaeto the Great.  You can find
him in the Tavern.  However, eventually you will win Mehmed II from King's
Path.  Switch to him when you can, *unless* you have already used rune stones
on Gwanggaeto by that point (the difference is noticeable, but not huge).

Give your assistant the following skill books:
* March Size Increase
* March Speed Increase
* Whichever of Ranged Troop HP *OR* Ranged Troop Defense is NOT on Elektra

### Light Spenders:

You will also use Elektra as your main ranged General, and this pair will be
your main PVP march.

Keep your eye out for any of the following (this is a ordered list)

* Charles XII 
* James Conrad
* Princess Kaguya
* Alfred the Great
* Tomyris
* Edward III 
* Simeon the Great (without dragon)
* Wallenstein

These are all available for paying players. Particularly, Alfred is available
in the Alliance Shop if you buy the Alliance Shop card.  Once you have invested
rune stones in any of these, *stick with that one*.  Note, these will be your
*assistant generals* because getting fragments for any of them (except possibly
Alfred if you spend to get the Alliance Shop card consistently) will
potentially be very expensive.

IF you pick Princess Kaguya, you *may* want to change the skill books on her:
* Siege Machine Attack
* Siege Machine Range Bonus
* March Size Increase

This build sacrifices speed and some durability in favor of mixing ranged and
siege into a single attack march.  This should be carefully considered as it
can cost many more gems for healing.
