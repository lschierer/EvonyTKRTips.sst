When looking at Cavalry generals, you need to consider your use case.  There are three use cases.

* Attacking
  * Rally attacks on forces with low amounts of ranged troops
  * Solo attacks on forces with low amounts of ranged troops
  * The first march intending to hold a building
* Reinforcing
  * Sending Cavalry to an alliance member's keep
  * Sending Cavalry to reinforce a building an alliance member
    already owns
* [Monster Hunting]

Unfortunately, the generals that are good at the attacking use case are at best mediocre for the reinforcing use case, and, with few exceptions, the vice versa. 
Similarly, while you can *usually* use generals that are good for the mounted attacking use case for [Monster Hunting], that is not always true, and you can *definitally* not depend on the reverse.
