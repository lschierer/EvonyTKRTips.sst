As you move beyond trying to play for free, you probably want to look at a premium monster hunting pair. Partly because it is fun to be able to kill the bigger monsters. Partly because the rewards they give will help you control your overall spending. Partly because other members in your alliance need the rewards. How much each of these motivates you will vary both from player to player and from day to day.

While there are a few good free Monster hunters, notably [Martinus] (if he has a dragon) all the truly great pairs include at least one premium general.
This changes regularly enough that I am including my table for displaying pair attributes, pre-filtered to display mounted monster hunters, with an [explanation] for how to use its data.

## Explanation

As you look at this, there are a few key things to consider.

- Everything I wrote in [Evaluating Generals] applies here.
- Some generals have colored dots next to their names. These have special  
  considerations. I hope to eventually have these considerations show up in
  tooltips.
  - Some generals conflict with certain skill books regardless of whether the
    skill book is assigned to them or the other general in the pair. Sometimes
    the general is strong enough that you do not care. These generals will have
    orange dots.
  - There are some generals whose buffs only activate with a spiritual beast or
    dragon. They are often very strong, and sometimes it is worth picking them.
    Be aware however, that you will not get the power listed unless you _can_
    assign the appropriate companion to that general. Unless there is a more
    severe problem also present, this will show up as a magenta dot.
  - Some generals only conflict with skill books present in the _other_ general
    of the pair, but not if the skill book is _their own_. This will be a
    blue dot. You need to be careful setting up your pair, and may find them
    less flexible in how you mix and match generals across different pairs.
- For Monster hunting the two most important characteristics are the attack
  buff and the March Size buff. These will control how big a monster you can
  kill.
- When you hunt monsters, you attack first. If you wound the monster, it
  attacks back.
  - The HP and Defense buffs determine your survivability, or, conversely, how
    much this counter-attack wounds you.
  - A severe enough counter-attack (ie you lose more than 10% of your total  
    march size) and you lose the overall attack.
  - Your choice of pair needs to consider your tolerance for wounded. The
    pairs with the strongest attack (and thus able to kill the biggest monsters
    soonest) are often _not_ the ones that will most reduce your wounded. It is
    perfectly reasonable to accept a slightly slower rate at which you can take
    on the next biggest monster in exchange for doing so with much less wounded.
- I currently have no way to display which generals are easier to get fragments for
- I currently have no way to assess the effects of soul binding on monster  
  hunting.
- I currently have no way to assess the effects of covenants on monster
  hunting.
- Since flexible specialities can be moved, I am not considering them at this
  time. If you are able to max out your generals, I assume you will add the relevant flexible specialities Monday through Thursday.
- I am _also_ not yet calculating the effect of standard skill books on buffs.
  Since some generals conflict with some skill books, this _is_ a flaw, and
  will hopefully eventually be addressed. I may even remember to update this
  note when I do so. _**This is important.**_ A general pair A with no skill books might show as weaker than another pair B, but if pair A has no conflicts and pair B does, the difference these skill books make will _sometimes_ tip the balance in favor of pair A.
