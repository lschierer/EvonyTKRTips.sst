When looking at siege generals, you need to consider your use case.  There are two use cases.

* Attacking
  * Siege bomb rallies
  * Stealing massive amounts of [RSS] from an otherwise dead keep.
  * Attacking a keep on your own
  * The first march intending to hold a building
* Reinforcing
  * Sending siege to an alliance member's keep
  * Sending siege to reinforce a building an alliance member
    already owns

Unfortunately, the generals that are good at the attacking use case are at best 
mediocre for the reinforcing use case.  However, unlike other troop types, with 
siege we find that while the best reinforcing pairs will not be the absolute 
best attack pairs, they will not be unnacceptably bad either.  **Light spenders
should look at the reinforcing table** and accept that their siege attack pair 
will never be optimized for attacking.  Since siege repair requires gems,
the repair bill alone would probably preclude siege attacks for these players
anyway.
