When looking at siege generals, you need to consider your use case.  There are two use cases.

* Attacking
  * Siege bomb rallies
  * Stealing massive amounts of [RSS] from an otherwise dead keep.
  * Attacking a keep on your own
  * The first march intending to hold a building
* Reinforcing
  * Sending siege to an alliance member's keep
  * Sending siege to reinforce a building an alliance member
    already owns

Unfortunately, the generals that are good at the attacking use case are at best mediocre for the reinforcing use case, and, with few exceptions, the vice versa.
