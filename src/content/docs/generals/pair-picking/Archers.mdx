When looking at archer generals, you need to consider your use case.  There are two use cases.

* Attacking
  * Rally attacks on forces with high amounts of mounted troops
  * Solo attacks on forces with high amounts of mounted troops
  * The first march intending to hold a building
* Reinforcing
  * Sending ranged troops to an alliance member's keep
  * Sending ranged troops to reinforce a building an alliance member
    already owns

Unfortunately, the generals that are good at the attacking use case are at best mediocre for the reinforcing use case, and, with few exceptions, the vice versa.
