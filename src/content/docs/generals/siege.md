In the [Overview][], I explain my thinking.  This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how I
arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you can
skip it and dive right in here. 

[Overview]: <{{< relref "overview.md" >}}>

Your Siege generals will be the *last* PvP generals you invest [rune stones][]
and [BoA][] on.  This is because siege troops require gems to heal.

### For Free to Play Players:

There are only two generals easily [ascended][] by a F2P player for siege troops:
* Matthias I (604)
* Ulysses S. Grant D (602)

That 'D' signifies that Grant requires a dragon to be of any use, and neither
of these are great options to begin with.  That being said, Napoleon is fairly
easy to win, so even a free player might get enough copies of him to give him
at least one or two red stars.  I am unsure how a Napoleon with one red star
compares to a Matthias with three or more red stars.

For your assistant general, assemble Suleiman the Magnificent from fragments
from relics.  He makes one of the best assistant generals for siege troops even
if you do have a premium general, and he pairs with all of these options.

### For Light Spenders

For light spenders, I am going to deviate from my general advice of sticking to
a main general that you can get for free.  This is because the siege general
*is* the last general you should be working on anyway.  You thus have more time
to slowly, over the course of (literally) years, assemble the fragments you
need to [ascend][] this general.  My advice is to hang onto every copy of all
three of the following generals that you come across:

* Zucca (738)
* John Churchill (712)
* Petronas (702) 

However, only actually add skill books to whichever one you happen to get
first, and only ever use this general in [BoC][] or [BoG][].

You have lots of options for pairings depending on which general ends up being
your main general, however, like my advice to the free players, Suleiman the
Magnificent makes the best assistant for all 3 of these. 

Eventually you will have your [ranged][], [ground][], [wall][], and not just
one [mounted][] but both a PvP and Monster pair in this type all maxed out on
[rune stones][], and all either [ascended][] or waiting on more fragments to
finish ascending.  *Then and only then* will you evaluate which of the three
above generals you have the most fragments of and from that which one to start
developing.  In fact, you might even wait until you have *Suleiman's*
specialties maxed out to four gold as well before deciding (although because
Suleiman is an assistant, do not ascend him).
