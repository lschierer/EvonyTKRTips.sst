Evony has a number of terms that require explanation.  I will attempt to define
those I use.

<dl>
    <dt><a name="ascending">ascending</a></dt>
    <dd>The use of Blood of Ares and general's fragments to increase a
        general's star count above 5. Stars 6-10 will show as red stars.</dd>

    <dt><a name="BoC"></a>Battle of Constantinople</dt>
    <dd>A [PvP event happening on many Saturdays. The event will run for
        1-5 Saturdays in a row, followed by several weeks of one of several
        different championship or all-stars events.</dd>

    <dt><a name="BoG">Battle of Gaugamela</a></dt>
    <dd>A [PvP] event happening on many Wednesdays.  The event will run for
        1-5 Wednesdays in a row, followed by several weeks of one of several
        different championship or all-stars events.</dd>

    <dt><a name="BoA">Blood of Ares</a></dt>
    <dd>An item required to [ascend] a general.</dd>

    <dt><a name="buble">bubble</a></dt>
    <dd>The game calls these 'Truce Agreements'. They look like semi-circular domes over your keep and protect you from attack.</dd>

    <dt><a name="buff">buff</a></dt>
    <dd>To increase in value either by percentage or by a specified amount, typically referring to the attributes of either a general or a type of troops.    </dd>

    <dt><a name="debuff">debuff</a></dt>
    <dd>To decrease in value either by percentage or by a specified amount, typically referring to the attributes of either a general or a type of troops.</dd>

    <dt><a name="Generals Hall">General's Hall</a></dt>
    <dd>One of the options available if you click on the 'Art Hall' building. This consists of a tabbed view, where each tab consists of rows of generals. Owning this general causes the corresponding face to change from greyscale to color. Owning all generals in the row gives a small reward. Certain rows are also prerequisites for a number of other more important things.</dd>

    <dt><a name="ghosting">ghosting</a></dt>
    <dd>Hiding your troops by using 60 minute rallies that you cancel before they launch. Troops in rallies cannot be attacked.</dd>

    <dt><a name="PvP">PvP</a></dt>
    <dd>Player versus Player, or when you are either attacking or attacked by troops controlled by another human, instead of things generated by the game.</dd>

    <dt><a name="rss">RSS</a></dt>
    <dd>Short for 'resources', this includes food, lumber, stone and ore. It is distinct from 'materials' which are used for crafting armor.</dd>

    <dt><a name="rune_stones">Rune Stones</a></dt>
    <dd>This item comes in four different varieties.  You need the correct
        stone to increase the level of a general's [specialty].</dd>

    <dt><a name="specialties">specialties</a></dt>
    <dd>Extra abilities for a general available when a general reaches level 25, and activated by the use of gems and rune stones. Each of the four specialties requires a different kind of rune stone.</dd>

    <dt><a name="speed-up">speed-up</a></dt>
    <dd>An item that increases the rate at which an activity occurs</dd>

    <dt><a name="splat">splat</a></dt>
    <dd>To attack in such a way that while you may technically win, the defender earns more *points* than you do.</dd>

    <dt><a name="SvS">SvS</a></dt>
    <dd>Server Versus Server; this is an even that happens every other week once your server reaches certain milestones. Your server is paired against another server, and each can teleport to the other to attack.</dd>
