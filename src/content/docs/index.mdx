## Why Another Evony Tips Site

### Tips for Budget Gamers

<div id="first">
  There are lots of sites out there with tips on playing Evony. Why am I
  creating yet another? I find that the advice I am giving younger and/or less
  knowledgable players differs from what I find on any single site out there.
  This is largely because so many of the sites are targeted on people who spend
  far more on the game than I do. While they have tons of very valuable info,
  figuring out the right course for the player with a smaller budget can be a
  real challenge. This site is based on my experiences playing on a more limited
  budget.
</div>

Much of the information here comes from other authors' work on other sites. In particular, I am heavily relying on the work of:

- [Evony Answers](https://www.evonyanswers.com/)
- [Evony: The King's Return GUIDE WIKI](https://evonyguidewiki.com/)
- [One Chilled Gamer](https://onechilledgamer.com/)
- [Evony The King's Return Guides](https://www.evonytkrguide.com/)

Many thanks to the incredible work put forth by those who have come before me on these sites in documenting Evony TKR.
