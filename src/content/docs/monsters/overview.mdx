The reports on the troops, generals and gear needed to kill the various
monsters in Evony are mostly very dated.  The game has grown very complicated,
and few of the monster hunting guides have kept up.  Here are some reports that
attempt to take into account the advantages of assistant generals, ascended
generals, blazons (minimally accounted for), and in at least some of them, the
effects of refining gear and spiritual beasts/dragons.  There are so many
factors involved that each of these is essentially anecdotal, rather than a
formula to follow to get the same results.
